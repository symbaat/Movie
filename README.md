> My movie Nuxt.js project

Project is written in Vue(Nuxt) including vuex store. The main reason that using the Vuex, because there are common datas that 
we need to access and recieve in the other components/pages. There are components like header, slider, top250, todayincinema, etc. And pages such as
index, films, ratings, search, film detail page, actors.
